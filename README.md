SMT203 Take Home Assignment 

Hello there! 

This is a pair-work take home assignment that @jameslimjy and I have been working on together. 
It has a simple database design in the models.py file, with API Calls in the app.py file to retrieve, add and update information from the database. 
To try it out, run the manage.py file. :-)

Thank you for visiting!
